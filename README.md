# docker-class-project

This is my repo for the class project in CS2304. To see the specs, see this page: https://cs2304.mikesir87.io/

This repo is currently at milestone 3.

To try out the container, clone the repo and use the command (assuming you have docker installed)

`docker-compose up`

Then, open a browser to localhost.
